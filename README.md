## Go Backend Application - Containerized and hosted on Kubernetes

A bare bone backend Go Application that could help:
>> Implement Cloud Native Application

>> Utilizes Docker Containerization - Can point to private repository

>> Easy to host on Kubernetes - Cloud or Private K8s cluster

>> Containers are extremely light small as compared to Nodejs for instance ;-)

>> Make file with actions - init install test build serve clean pack deploy ship
